Version: 0.0.4
Date: 2021-xx-xx
  Features:
    - Initial Release.
    - Trains just work with tunnels, pathing through them. Set up a trains schedule to go to a point on the other side of a tunnel and it will be used automatically.
    - Buildable tunnel parts; portals (entrance/exit), regular underground segments and underground segments with tracks crossing them. The underground segments can be fast replaced between.
    - Tunnel parts can be mined and destroyed. Mining is blocked while a tunnel is in use. Destroying a tunnel part kills any train carriages in the tunnel as the tunnel collapses.
    - Tunnels are built straight in a horizontal and vertical orientation. Tunnels can not cross one another.
    - Tunnel underground segments can be driven and walked over, but not built on.
    - Temporary graphics and icons that work from the editor (unsorted category).
    - Trains can reverse through tunnels if their path forwards is lost.
